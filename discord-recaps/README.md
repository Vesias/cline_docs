## Cline Discord Recap - December 28, 2024

### TLDR;

DeepSeek v3 integration discussions center on token efficiency and cost optimization ($0.67/26.79M tokens reported). Custom instruction patterns evolve to handle model-specific behaviors. MCP discussions advance toward programmatic execution patterns and multi-instance architectures.

### Cline Releases

*   No new releases today. Users validating v3.0.8's diff handling improvements, particularly around DeepSeek v3's auto-formatting behavior. [View discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1275535550845292637/1275535550845292640/1322354105896800320)

### 3 Big Takeaways/Conversations

*   **Model Selection & Cost Optimization**
    *   DeepSeek v3 proving highly efficient for routine code tasks - benchmarked at $0.67 for 26.79M tokens in extended use [Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1275535550845292637/1275535550845292640/1322345334915207249)
    *   Users implementing context-aware model switching: DeepSeek v3 for code generation/edits, Sonnet for large-context needs (>100k tokens) [Pattern Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1275535550845292637/1275535550845292640/1322344172170252289)
