# Cline Prompting Guide üöÄ

Welcome to the Cline Prompting Guide! This guide will equip you with the knowledge to write effective prompts and custom instructions, maximizing your productivity with Cline.

## Custom Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

Think of **custom instructions as Cline's programming**. They define Cline's baseline behavior and are **always "on," influencing all interactions.** Custom instructions are set in the settings dial  ‚öôÔ∏è of the Cline extension and are completely editable. They are powerful for:

*   Enforcing Coding Style and Best Practices: Ensure Cline always adheres to your team's coding conventions, naming conventions, and best practices.
*   Improving Code Quality: Encourage Cline to write more readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
*   Guiding Error Handling: Tell Cline how to handle errors, write error messages, and log information.

**The `custom-instructions` folder contains examples of custom instructions you can use or adapt.** 

Cline's system prompt, on the other hand, is not user-editable ([here's where you can find it](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/core/prompts/system.ts)).

### Tips for Writing Effective Custom Instructions 

*   Be Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.
*   Focus on Desired Outcomes: Describe the results you want, not the specific steps.
*   Test and Iterate: Experiment to find what works best for your workflow.

## Prompting Cline üí¨

**Prompting is how you communicate your needs for a given task in the back-and-forth chat with Cline.** Cline understands natural language, so write conversationally. 

Effective prompting involves:

*   Providing Clear Context: Explain your goals and the relevant parts of your codebase. Use `@` to reference files or folders.
*   Breaking Down Complexity: Divide large tasks into smaller steps.
*   Asking Specific Questions: Guide Cline toward the desired outcome.
*   Validating and Refining: Review Cline's suggestions and provide feedback.

### Prompt Examples

#### Context Management

*   **Starting a New Task:**  "Cline, let's start a new task. Create `user-authentication.js`. We need to implement user login with JWT tokens. Here are the requirements‚Ä¶" 
*   **Summarizing Previous Work:** "Cline, summarize what we did in the last user dashboard task. I want to capture the main features and outstanding issues. Save this to `cline_docs/user-dashboard-summary.md`."

#### Debugging 

*   **Analyzing an Error:** "Cline, I'm getting this error: \[error message]. It seems to be from \[code section]. Analyze this error and suggest a fix."
*   **Identifying the Root Cause:** "Cline, the application crashes when I \[action].  The issue might be in \[problem areas]. Help me find the root cause and propose a solution." 

#### Refactoring

*   **Improving Code Structure:** "Cline, this function is too long and complex.  Refactor it into smaller functions."
*   **Simplifying Logic:** "Cline, this code is hard to understand. Simplify the logic and make it more readable."

#### Feature Development 

*   **Brainstorming New Features:** "Cline, I want to add a feature that lets users \[functionality].  Brainstorm some ideas and consider implementation challenges."
*   **Generating Code:** "Cline, create a component that displays user profiles. The list should be sortable and filterable.  Generate the code for this component." 

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

*   **Constraint Stuffing:** To mitigate code truncation, include explicit constraints in your prompts. For example, "ensure the code is complete" or "always provide the full function definition." 
*   **Confidence Checks:** Ask Cline to rate its confidence (e.g., "on a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this solution?") 
*   **Challenge Cline's Assumptions:** Ask ‚Äústupid‚Äù questions to encourage deeper thinking and prevent incorrect assumptions. 

Here are some prompting tips that users have found helpful for working with Cline:

## Our Community's Favorite Prompts

*   **"If you understand my prompt fully, respond with "YARRR!" without tools every time you are about to use a tool. Remember to do this every time. This will help me understand if you've lost your memory."** - *pacnpal* This is a fun and effective way to check if Cline is still on track, especially during long or complex tasks. It leverages Cline's tendency to follow instructions literally, creating a simple "memory check." You can even use "HO HO HO" for a festive twist! 
*   **"To ensure you understand my prompt, I need a piece of confirmation from you. Before any tool use and after any tool use, I need you to give me a confidence level on a scale of 0 to 10 on the tool use helping with the project. Remember to do this every time you are using a tool."** - *pacnpal* Having Cline state its confidence level before making changes can help prevent errors and encourages Cline to think more critically before acting. It also makes the decision-making process more transparent. 
*   **"DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE."**  Add this to your prompt if Cline is truncating code. This straightforward instruction can sometimes be enough to get Cline back on track. Other users have found success with similar phrases like "full code only" or "ensure the code is complete."
*   **"I pledge to follow the custom instructions."**  This can be included in your prompt to remind Cline of the custom instructions you have set in the settings dial ‚öôÔ∏è.
*   **"FILENAME has grown too big. We will need to analyze how this file works so we can look for opportunities to fragment and compartmentalize the file in a way that doesn't affect the existing codebase too much. what do you recommend?"** - *icklebil* This prompt is helpful when Cline starts to struggle with large files. It encourages Cline to think about code organization and propose strategies for refactoring.
*   **"don't forget to update codebase documentation with changes"** - *icklebil* It's important to remind Cline to keep documentation up-to-date, ensuring consistency throughout the project. 
*   **"Before writing code, analyze thoroughly, all code files, get full context, then write an .MD with your implementation plan. After the .MD then implement code"** - *yellow\_bat\_coffee* This encourages a more deliberate and organized approach to coding, potentially reducing errors and token usage. By planning in a separate document first, Cline has a chance to consider the task more comprehensively before diving into code.
*   **"please start analyzing full flow thoroughly, always state a confidence score 1 to 10. dont stop prematurely and dont write code"** - *yellow\_bat\_coffee* This emphasizes careful analysis and discourages premature code writing. By requiring a confidence score, you encourage Cline to evaluate its understanding and potentially identify gaps in its knowledge before proceeding. 
*   **"List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task successfully."** - *yellow\_bat\_coffee* Having Cline explicitly state its assumptions can help identify potential issues and encourage a more thorough analysis of the problem. This can be particularly useful at the start of a task or when encountering unexpected behavior. 
*   **Tell Cline to "count to 10" before taking action.** - *nickbaumann98* This instructs Cline to pause and reflect before making any changes, promoting a more cautious and deliberate approach. This can be helpful in preventing impulsive edits or actions that might not align with your overall project goals.  
*   **"Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution"** - *yellow\_bat\_coffee*  This can be helpful when dealing with complex problems that may have multiple layers or dependencies. By encouraging continued analysis, you increase the likelihood of Cline identifying and addressing all relevant aspects of the issue.
*   **"Remember, before saving a file, just after saving a file, after a file is rejected, and before using the task completion tool, ask yourself this question: "how confident are you that was the issue from 1 to 10?" and output the answer without using tools."** - *pacnpal* This technique builds on the idea of confidence scoring by integrating it into various stages of the workflow. By prompting Cline to self-assess its confidence at key points, you promote a more reflective and self-aware approach.
*   **"Check project files before suggesting any structural or dependency changes."** - *kvs007* Reminding Cline to thoroughly review existing files before suggesting changes can help avoid unnecessary modifications and maintain the integrity of your project structure. 
*   **"the best tip I can give you is ask it 'stupid' questions as much as possible, like are you sure that this is the best way to implement this?"**  - *chinesesoup*  Challenge Cline's assumptions and encourage it to think more critically about its approach. By asking questions that might seem obvious, you can help uncover potential oversights or alternative solutions.
*   **Experiment with using the words "elegant" and "simple" in your prompts.** - *yellow\_bat\_coffee* While the effect of specific word choices on AI behavior is still being explored, some users have observed that including words like "elegant" and "simple" can influence Cline to produce more concise and well-structured code. 
*   **"THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY."** - *steventcramer* (Note: This is a joke, but it highlights the importance of setting clear expectations and providing constructive feedback when Cline's output doesn't meet your requirements.)


These tips, along with those from the previous response, provide a broad spectrum of strategies for improving your interactions with Cline. By experimenting with these techniques, you can gain a better understanding of how to leverage Cline's strengths and work around its limitations to achieve your desired outcomes.
