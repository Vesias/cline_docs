# Installing Essential Development Tools with Cline

When you start coding, you'll need some essential development tools installed on your computer. Cline can help you install everything you need in a safe, guided way.

## The Essential Tools

Here are the core tools you'll need for development:

- **Homebrew**: A package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install other tools
- **Node.js & npm**: Required for JavaScript and web development
- **Git**: For tracking changes in your code and collaborating with others
- **Python**: A programming language used by many development tools
- **Additional utilities**: Tools like wget and jq that help with downloading files and processing data

## Let Cline Install Everything

Copy this prompt and paste it into Cline:

```bash
